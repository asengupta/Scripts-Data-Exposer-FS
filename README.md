# Scripts-Data-Exposer-FS
Adds functions to HKS that let you access more data about the game to use in your scripts.

See examples/tutorials in NewHksInfo.lua

This fork adds some more functionality in a slightly more accessible API. Currently, allows teleport to target, and teleporting target to player.

In your HKS, use:

    -- Teleport to target
    act(50000, 1)

or

    -- Teleport target to player
    act(50000, 2)

More functionality may be added as per requirements.
